Their target is to reach 100,000 students by 2028, which represents about 17% of the projected 600,000+ students in computer science programs. The primary strategy for driving this enrollment growth will be through their direct-to-student model, where individual students opt-in to virtual CodePath courses (referred to as CP Direct). This approach allows CodePath to expand its reach and impact significantly by offering personalized education, mentorship, career support, and work experience to students, thereby preparing them for careers in tech.\n"
